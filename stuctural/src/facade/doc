When you need to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem
When you want to layer your subsystems
When you want to decouple a client from a complex subsystem


Facade: Simplifies a complex system by providing a higher-level interface
Facade: Works with multiple objects to simplify their collective functionality
Facade: Usually provides a new, simplified interface
Choose Facade when you need to simplify a complex system




* Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by wrapping a complicated subsystem.
* This reduces the learning curve necessary to successfully leverage the subsystem.
* It also promotes decoupling the subsystem from its potentially many clients.
